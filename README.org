उपकरण (upakarana) is a set of CL utilities that have their origin in matlisp.

* functionality
The core package (#:upakarana) contains quite a few utility functions & macros; additionally the following packages exist with the "#:upakarana-" prefix,
- vector
  usual foldl, foldr etc. and a useful iteration macro
- union-find
  standard UFD with one-pass path-compression
- hash-set
  utitilies for using a hash table as a set
- doubly-linked-list
  add a rdc with your car and cdr; also defines iteration macros for iterate.
- fibonacci-heap
  usual fib heap; node tracking with an array table.
- binary-heap
  everyone's favorite heap using an extensible vector; no node tracking support as yet (affects graph search).
- fourier-motzkin
  fourier-motzkin elimination of variables from linear (integer) inequalities for polyhedral enumeration; not accelerated.
- simplex
  revised simplex method for solving sparse LPs (currently uses explicit basis inverse).
  branch-and-bound ILP solver using dual-simplex warm-start.
- orthogonal-polynomial
  classical ortho-polynomial families; their evaluation, derivatives & quadrature (Golub-Welsch)
- ziggurat
  generate a ziggurat sampler automatically using bisection, Newton-Raphson and complex-step (Cauchy-Riemann) AD.
- random
  fast random samplers, notably for exponential (ziggurat), normal (ziggurat) and gamma distributions

The tests for these packages should also serve as examples; these can be found in 't/'.

* dependencies
  उपकरण/upakarana depends on: {~alexandria~, ~iterate~}. 
  These are quicklisp-able.

- The symmetric-tridiagonal eigenvalue/projected eigenvector solver IMTQLX is originally from,
  'Sylvan Elhay, Jaroslav Kautsky, Algorithm 655: IQPACK, FORTRAN Subroutines for the Weights of Interpolatory Quadrature, ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, Volume 13, Number 4, December 1987, pages 399-415.',

  The code from the paper was f2cl-ed and simplified to standard Common Lisp; documentation comes from,

- Certain samplers in random.lisp come from disparate sources; these are acknowledged therein.
